# Ethereum Awesome Lists

Inspired by [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python), and other [awesome lists](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go), it made sense to have a repo for awesome lists for Ethereum.  If you have contributions for an "awesome" list, please do submit pull requests.  The goal is to have a list that is more varied, comprehensive, and not-quite-as-selective as the lists on ethereum.org.
